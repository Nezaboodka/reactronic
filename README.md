# **Reactronic** - Transactionally Reactive State Management

Reactronic is a JavaScript library that provides
[transactionally reactive](https://blog.nezaboodka.com/post/2019/593-modern-database-should-natively-support-transactionally-reactive-programming)
state management for a Web application.

Transactional reactivity means that state changes are being made
in an isolated data snapshot and then, once atomically committed,
are **consistently propagated** to corresponding visual components
for rendering. And all that automatically, transparently, and
in a fine-grained way.

## Conceptual Model

Transactional reactivity is based on the three fundamental concepts:

  - **State** - a set of objects that store data of an application;
  - **Transaction** - a function that changes state objects in an atomic way;
  - **Cache** - a computed value having associated function that is automatically called to renew the cache in response to state changes.

The following picture illustrates relationships between the concepts
in the source code:

![Reactronic](https://blog.nezaboodka.com/img/reactronic.jpg)

Below is the detailed description of each concept.

### State

State is a set of objects that store data of an application.
All state objects are transparently hooked to track access to
their properties, both on reads and writes.

``` typescript
@state
class MyModel {
  url: string = "https://nezaboodka.com";
  content: string = "database reinvented";
  timestamp: Date = Date.now();
}
```

In the example above, the class `MyModel` is instrumented with the
`@state` decorator and its properties `url`, `content`, and `timestamp`
are hooked.

### Transaction

Transaction is a function that changes state objects in an atomic way.
Every transaction function is instrumented with hooks to provide
transparent atomicity (by implicit context switching and isolation).

``` typescript
@state
class MyModel {
  // ...
  @transaction
  async load(url: string): Promise<void> {
    this.url = url;
    this.content = await fetch(url);
    this.timestamp = Date.now();
  }
}
```

In the example above, the function `load` is a transaction
that makes changes to `url`, `content` and `timestamp` properties.
While the transaction is running, the changes are visible only inside
the transaction itself. The new values become atomically visible
outside of the transaction only upon its completion.

Atomicity is achieved by making changes in an isolated data
snapshot that is visible outside of the transaction (e.g.
displayed on user screen) only when it is finished. Multiple
objects and their properties can be changed with full respect
to the all-or-nothing principle. To do so, separate data
snapshot is automatically maintained for each transaction.
That is a logical snapshot that does not create a full copy
of all the data.

Compensating actions are not needed in case of the transaction
failure, because all the changes made by the transaction in its
logical snapshot are simply discarded. In case the transaction
is successfully committed, affected caches are invalidated and
corresponding caching functions are re-executed in a proper
order (but only when all the data changes are fully applied).

Asynchronous operations (promises) are supported out of the box
during transaction execution. The transaction may consist
of a set of asynchronous calls prolonging transaction until
completion of all of them. An asynchronous call may spawn other
asynchronous calls, which prolong transaction execution until
the whole chain of asynchronous operations is fully completed.

### Cache

Cache is a computed value having an associated function that
is automatically called to renew the cache in response to state
changes. Each cache function is instrumented with hooks to
transparently subscribe it to those state object properties
and other caches, which it uses during execution.

``` tsx
class MyView extends React.Component<MyModel> {
  @cache(Renew.OnDemand)
  render() {
    const m: MyModel = this.props; // just a shortcut
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{m.url}</h1>
        <div>{m.content}</div>
      </div>
    );
  } // render is subscribed to m.url and m.content

  @cache(Renew.Immediately)
  trigger(): void {
    if (this.render.reactronic.isInvalidated)
      this.setState({}); // ask React to re-render
  } // trigger is subscribed to render
}
```

In the example above, the cache of the `trigger` function is
transparently subscribed to the cache of the `render` function.
In turn, the `render` function is subscribed to the `url` and
`content` properties of a corresponding `MyModel` object.
Once `url` or `content` values are changed, the `render` cache
becomes invalidated and causes cascade invalidation of the
`trigger` cache. The `trigger` cache is marked for immediate
renewal, thus its function is immediately called by Reactronic
to renew the cache. While executed, the `trigger` function
enqueues re-rendering request to React, which calls `render`
function and it renews its cache marked for on-demand renew.

In general case, cache is automatically and immediately invalidated
when changes are made in those state object properties that were used
by its function. And once invalidated, the function is automatically
executed again to renew it, either immediately or on demand.

Reactronic **takes full care of tracking dependencies** between
all the state objects and caches (observers and observables).
With Reactronic, you no longer need to create data change events
in one set of objects, subscribe to these events in other objects,
and manually maintain switching from the previous state to a new
one.

### Advanced Options

There are multiple options to fine tune transactional reactivity.

**Latency** option defines a delay between cache invalidation and
invocation of the caching function to renew the cache:

  - `(ms)` - delay in milliseconds;
  - `Renew.Immediately` - renew immediately with zero latency;
  - `Renew.OnDemand` - renew on access if cache has been invalidated;
  - `Renew.Manually` - manual renew (explicit only);
  - `Renew.DoesNotCache` - renew on every call of the function.

**Isolation** option defines if a transaction is independent from the parent one:

  - `Isolation.Default` - transaction prolongs parent one, but reaction (renewing of affected caches) is started as a separate transaction;
  - `Isolation.ProlongParentTransaction` - both transaction and reaction prolong parent transaction;
  - `Isolation.StartSeparateTransaction` - always executed as a separate self-sufficient transaction.

**AsyncCalls** option defines how to handle multiple async calls of the same function:

  - `AsyncCalls.Single` - fail if there is an existing concurrent call;
  - `AsyncCalls.Reused` - reuse the result of the existing concurrent call (if any);
  - `AsyncCalls.Relayed` - cancel and supresede the existing concurrent call;
  - `AsyncCalls.Multiple` - multiple simultaneous calls are allowed.

**Indicator** option is an object holding the status of running functions,
which it is attached to. A single indicator object can be shared
between multiple transaction and cache functions, thus maintaining
consolidated busy/idle status for all of them.

## Notes

Inspired by: MobX, Nezaboodka, Excel.

Key Reactronic principles and differentiators:

  - No compromises on consistency, clarity, and simplicity;
  - Minimalism and zero boilerplating (it's not a framework bloating your code);
  - Asynchrony, patches, undo/redo, conflict resolving are provided out of the box;
  - Seamless integration with transactionally reactive object-oriented databases like [Nezaboodka](https://nezaboodka.com/#products).

To-Do list:

  - History/undo/redo API and implementation
  - Conflict resolition API
  - Patches API
  - Sync API and implementation
